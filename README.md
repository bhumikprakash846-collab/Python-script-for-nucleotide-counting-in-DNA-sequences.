python code for converting dna to rna , validating a dna or rna sequence and reversing a dna sequence
central dogma of life:
Replication: DNA polymerase duplicates DNA during cell division.
Transcription: RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA from a DNA template.
Translation: Ribosomes use mRNA codons to assemble amino acids into proteins.

DNA  ──(transcription)──►  RNA  ──(translation)──►  Protein
DNA  →  RNA  →  Protein
 ↑        ↓
 |        └── Reverse Transcription (RNA → DNA, e.g., retroviruses)
 └── Replication (DNA → DNA)
